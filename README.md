# Analyzing Portfolio Risk and Return

In this Challenge, we are assuming a quantitative analyst for a FinTech investing platform. This platform aims to offer clients a one-stop online investment solution for their retirement portfolios that’s both inexpensive and high quality. To keep the costs low, the firm uses algorithms to build each client's portfolio. The algorithms choose from various investment styles and options.

We are evaluating four new investment options for inclusion in the client portfolios. Legendary fund and hedge-fund managers run all four selections. You’ll need to determine the fund with the most investment potential based on key risk-management metrics: the daily returns, standard deviations, Sharpe ratios, and betas.
